    $(command)
    put %{-1}$(command) to replace $(command) with nothing
    %{0}$(command) gets replaced with the first word of the result
    %{do-first-index:} gets replaces with the result of a specific $(command)
    %{do-first-index:word-index} gets replaced with the word index of a specific $(cmd)
end of statement:
    putting a [; on its own line seperates commands.
calc:
    $[calculation]
special commands:
    [count]:<range>[cmd/...]
    [t:cmd (type)
    [s:cmd (silence command result)
    [d:cmd (delete your message)
    [redir([prefix]:var-name):cmd (put cmd output into the variable)
escapes:
    \n: new line
    \t: tab

    \V{prefix:variable name}: get a variable from a specific scope (. for global and % for user)
